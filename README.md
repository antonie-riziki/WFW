# Women in Future Work (WFW)
Using MeTTa with AI to eliminate borders to women getiing worth of their knowledge


# 🌸 WFW – Swipe. Match. Work. Worldwide.

> **AI shouldn’t replace women. It should reintroduce them to the world.**

WFW is an **AGI-driven platform** that connects skilled women—particularly those displaced by automation and AI—to global employment opportunities that match their knowledge, values, and expertise.  
Inspired by platforms like Tinder, WFW uses **AI reasoning and matching** to eliminate borders and bias, ensuring that women can **reclaim their worth in the age of AI**.

---

## 💡 Project Overview

Many women, especially in administrative, HR, and secretarial roles, have lost jobs due to AI automation.  
WFW aims to **empower these women** by providing them a digital bridge to remote, borderless job opportunities worldwide.

Using **MeTTa (Meta Type Talk)** reasoning within an AGI framework, the platform interprets skills, experiences, and preferences semantically — understanding **who a person is beyond a CV**, and **what opportunities truly fit** their expertise.

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Profile Setup**  
   Users create profiles highlighting their skills, experiences, and aspirations.  

2. **Semantic Reasoning (MeTTa + AI)**  
   The AGI engine uses symbolic reasoning to interpret transferable skills, ethics, and work styles, recommending roles that align with each user’s unique profile.  

3. **AI Matching Interface**  
   A Tinder-like “swipe” experience allows users to explore job matches globally, based on fairness, value alignment, and skill compatibility.  

4. **Connection & Collaboration**  
   Matched employers and job seekers can chat securely, guided by AI-generated insights and skill relevance scores.

## ⚠️ Misuse & Risk Mitigation

### 1. **Bias & Fairness**
- Risk: AI bias in recommending certain job categories to specific profiles.  
- Mitigation: Implement continuous **fairness auditing** and **human-in-the-loop evaluation**.

### 2. **Data Privacy**
- Risk: Misuse of personal data or exposure to unsafe employers.  
- Mitigation: Encrypted communication, **zero-knowledge credential verification**, and ethical data governance.

### 3. **Exploitation of Job Seekers**
- Risk: Fake employers or predatory job offers targeting women.  
- Mitigation: Verified employer accounts and **trust scoring system** for authenticity.

### 4. **AI Hallucination & Overreliance**
- Risk: AI-generated matches that misrepresent roles or expectations.  
- Mitigation: All AI recommendations include **transparency explanations** (“Why this match?”) and manual verification options.
